### Question 1: 
The most interesting idea for me was the concept of starting with tiny habits and letting them grow gradually, making it easier to build and sustain habits.

### Question 2:

- M (Motivation): Make the behavior something you want to do.
- A (Ability): Make the behavior easy to do.
- P (Prompt): Trigger the behavior with a prompt.
### Question 3:
 Celebrating after each successful completion is crucial because it reinforces the positive feelings associated with the habit, making it more likely to become ingrained.

### Question 4: 
The most interesting idea was the emphasis on continuous improvement by focusing on getting 1% better every day, leading to significant progress over time.

### Question 5:
 The book emphasizes that changing habits is not about goals but about identity. By focusing on your identity and the type of person you want to become, habits become more sustainable.

### Question 6:
 To make a habit easier, the book suggests making the cue obvious, the craving attractive, the response easy, and the reward satisfying.

### Question 7:
 To make a habit harder, the book suggests making the cue invisible, the craving unattractive, the response difficult, and the reward unsatisfying.

## Reflection
### Question 8:
 If the habit is to exercise more, make the cue obvious by laying out workout clothes, make it attractive by finding an enjoyable exercise, and make it easy by starting with a short routine.

### Question 9:
 If the habit is to reduce social media use, make the cue invisible by putting the phone out of sight, make it unattractive by focusing on negative effects, and make it hard by using app blockers or setting time limits.
